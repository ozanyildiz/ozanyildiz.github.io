I decided to share the things that I found useful on the internet. This is some
kind of sharing of my bookmarks. I hope that you find these as useful as I do.
Here we go!

* Lately I was very unproductive and procrastinating everything that I was
supposed to do. In the meantime, I came up to a framework called [Getting
Things Done](http://hamberg.no/gtd/). It presents a guide to organize the
things that you're willing to do. So you are automatically passing the very
dangerous *deciding what to do next phase*. Because sometimes this phase
takes too long time and you're ending up not doing the actual things you
wanted to do.

[Here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8628605) is the hacker news
discussion where you can find  people's advices for GTD and tools to apply
it.

* Sometimes we could be picky about the editor theme and font we are going to
use for programming. [This
site](http://www.slant.co/topics/67/~what-are-the-best-programming-fonts)
solves the half of the problem and lists the nicest programming fonts.
Worth to check out if you are in search of this kind of stuff.

* Experienced sysadmin [Justin Weissig](https://twitter.com/jweissig_) is
making screencasts about his expertise. I found [his
site](https://sysadmincasts.com/
) while I was looking for sources for Linux containers and Docker. His
presentations are well-prepared and detailed and most importantly not
boring. I will definitely continue to follow his screencasts.

* When you choose Facebook or Twitter account to sign up a web site,
a standard called OAuth is being used. If you are a web developer, you
probably knew that already. If you want to know how this protocol works
under the hood there's
a [post](http://blog.varonis.com/introduction-to-oauth/) which explains
OAuth in plain English. If you want to step further and learn more
about OAuth and OAuth2, you can also check
[this](http://aaronparecki.com/articles/2012/07/29/1/oauth2-simplified)
amazing post.

* Docker is the hype of the recent times. If you get into this world,
you may heard the CoreOS. If you don't know much about it or want to
learn more (including etcd and fleet), you can watch [this
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4oaIW37tU4) which also has
nice examples.

* A nice question and as nice answers on Quora: [What can I learn in
Computer Programming in just 10 minutes that could be useful for
the rest of my
life?](http://www.quora.com/What-can-I-learn-in-Computer-Programming-in-just-10-minutes-that-could-be-useful-for-the-rest-of-my-life)

* If you're looking for someone to explain the APIs like you're
five, your cure is Zapier's [An Introduction to
API](https://zapier.com/learn/apis/) course.

This is just the beginning. I'm planning to write more stuff like
this and make a post series which I named Hey, I've Found These.
