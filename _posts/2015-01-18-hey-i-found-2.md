Yaaay, the second post is up! In this episode you will find technical and also
non-technical stuff. Hope you find something useful that interests you. Let's
start!

* While I was digging at hackernews like I always do, I came up to [this
article](http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2014/12/30/how-to-learn-efficiently/)
called How to Learn Efficiently which emphasizes on the concept of interleaved
study. After reading that, I visited the [comment
section](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8815148) of the thread and saw
that one the users was suggesting an online course called
[Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning).
Lucky me! The course is still ongoing and just at week 3. I
completed the first week right away and learned a lot. The thing that got me at
the first week was that sleeping is so much important for the sake of healthy
learning process. So it is strongly recommended if you want to learn how the 
brain works.

* Speaking of online courses, [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/)
is a great source for them. You can see which courses are starting soon and
review of the students who took the course previously.

* [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) shared a categorized list of articles that
is most-read by its users.
[Here](http://getpocket.com/p/pocket-hits-2014/programming?ep=32) is the list
of the articles in the Programming category.

* With the advice of a friend,
I [bought](https://twitter.com/ozanyyildiz/status/555374425844219904)
[The Little
Schemer](http://www.amazon.com/The-Little-Schemer-4th-Edition/dp/0262560992)
to begin learning functional programming. The book is amazing so far. The
structure of the book based on questions and answers. It is an unusual tecnique
to form a book but definitely a good way to learn.

* [Stephen Diehl](https://twitter.com/smdiehl), a haskell enthusiast, is
[writing a tutorial](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/) on building a simple
functional programming language from first principles. The first eight chapter
is done and according to his plan, the tutorial will be entirely finished at
the end of August.

* As you can tell, I got into functional programming, very different
paradigm for someone with imperative paradigm background. If you don't anything
about it and at want to at least have an idea you can read [Don’t Be Scared Of
Functional Programming](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/07/02/dont-be-scared-of-functional-programming/)
by Smashing Magazine.

* I found a site, [Assembly](https://assembly.com/) whose purpose is connecting
people who has ideas and people who wants to contribute projects. Every task
has its own reward and the person who completed the task gets the reward. If
the product you contributed starts to earn money, you also earn money based on
those reward points.

* This episode's Quora question is [What are the best-kept secrets of great
programmers?](http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-kept-secrets-of-great-programmers/)

* An awesome podcast series called [Talking
Machines](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/blog/) is started by Katherine
Gorman (journalist) and Ryan Adams (Harvard professor). They're
posting new episodes biweekly. A nice way to spend time on morning commutes,
I think.

* If you want to read more, take the
[advice](http://austinkleon.com/2014/12/29/how-to-read-more/) from 
[Austin Kleon](https://twitter.com/austinkleon).

I planned to continue this blog series by writing a blog post for every week.
But sometimes, *(whining!)* it can be hard to sit down and organize the post. 
That's why there might be some long term delays. Anyway, have a good one!
